                    <p>This was the first project I worked on during my 8-month co-op at Belcan. My team was
                        assigned with the task of reworking an existing Boeing 777X stress analysis tool. The
                        previous tool took 72 hours to run and lacked usability. Using a Graham scan algorithm, only
                        the critical loadcases were considered. This reduced the total run time to under 1 hour while
                        maintaining 99.9% accuracy to the original tool. We also fixed a couple errors found in the
                        previous tool. Our team finished this project ahead of the assigned deadline and Boeing was
                        very impressed with our work. Our tool was ultimately accepted by Boeing and is currently
                        being used by stress engineers working on the 777X.

                    <h4>Boeing Structural Repair Manuals</h4>
                    <p>For my second project at Belcan, my team and I were assigned with the task of updating
                        structural repair manuals (SRMs) for multiple Boeing 777X wing structures. The SRMs
                        consisted of both Repairable Damage Limits (RDL) and Allowable Damage Limits (ADL). Our team
                        began by rerunning each analysis using the new set of loads and updated engineering geometry.
                        Each analysis provided our team with updated margins of safety. The ADL margins told us how
                        much damage was allowed on each part and what types of damage each part could withstand.
                        The RDL margins told us how repairing a damaged part impacted its functionality and safety.
                        After my team and I finished all required analyses and checked each other's work, we updated
                        the structural repair manuals. Our team finished this project by the assigned deadline and
                        Boeing was pleased with our work.

                    <h4>Boeing Centralized Repository</h4>
                    <p>For my third and final Project at Belcan, my team and I were assigned with the task of
                        creating a centralized repository containing fastener and element data for new Boeing 777X
                        part iterations. From CATIA, we exported material, layup, thickness, shim, porosity and
                        butt-splicing data. Extracting this data was simple, but organizing everything
                        into a centralized repository by element ID and fastener ID was an immense challenge.
                        Our team accomplished this through coordinate-matching in Excel VBA. To avoid incorrect
                        matching, we used a tolerance of 0.05 inches. This required us to use identical coordinates for
                        each of the data extractions listed above. This requirement was extremely tedious, but we were
                        able to overcome this challenge. Towards the end of the project, we validated our data for
                        every part by comparing the data in our repository to the CATIA data. After we ensured that
                        our data was valid, we made our repository compatible with all Boeing stress analysis software
                        (.csz, .bdf, .dta, etc.).

                    <h4>Thermal Camera Calibration</h4>
                    <p>This is a project I worked on at the University of Washington Autonomous Flight and Systems
                        Laboratory. My lab partner and I were tasked with calibrating and overlaying thermal imagery on
                        top of RGB imagery, a feat that has never been accomplished before.
                        We started by designing a physical apparatus that could be used for camera calibration for both
                        thermal and RGB imagery. We used the idea of checkerboard, as white and black squares have
                        contrasting heat properties. However, since heat dissipates, getting the pattern to show up in
                        the thermal camera was by far the hardest part of this project. Using aluminum squares on an
                        acrylic board and applying a heat gun for about 15 seconds, we were able to replicate the
                        checkerboard in the thermal camera.

                        After we were able to finally replicate the pattern, we calibrated the thermal camera using
                        OpenCV in Python. We were able to get the program to recognize the checkerboard pattern and
                        properly draw lines. Knowing that our design was successful, future work would have consisted
                        of using a laser cutter to get a more precise grid and producing more pictures to make our
                        calibration more valid.

                        While this project was fun and taught us a lot about camera calibration and architecture, our
                        research professor decided it would be best for us to move onto another project and put this
                        one on hold, given its difficulty and the fact that it has yet to be accomplished.

                    <h4>Wilderness Search and Rescue</h4>
                    <p>Utilizing high performance computing and state-of-the-art computer vision
                        algorithms, our team at UW AFSL provided autonomous perception capabilities for UAVs to assist
                        first responders in wilderness search and rescue operations. The implementation of autonomous
                        UAVs significantly reduces the mission time and rescue team fatality rate.

                        My team and I developed machine learning algorithms that taught drones the difference
                        between a human and a dog, deer, etc. These algorithms were implemented for both thermal
                        and RGB cameras. Both cameras are equally important in search and rescue missions, as RGB
                        imagery works best in plain sight and thermal imagery can spot humans through thick
                        vegetation. A confidence score can be seen above each human displaying the droneâ€™s

                    <h4>SolidWorks Drone</h4>
                    <p>For my final project in my CAD class at the University of Washington, I designed a
                        drone with functional rotors. I used SolidWorks and my final assembly had zero interference
                        between parts.

                    <h4>Drone Camera Mount</h4>
                    <p>For this project, my team and I had to create a mount that would be used to attach a relay
                        device and two cameras to a drone. We had to consider multiple parameters in our design,
                        such as total weight, material strength and aerodynamics. After multiple design iterations,
                        we were finally able to 3D print a mount that fulfilled all of our needs during flight tests.

                        The relay device was used to expand the search radius of the UAV beyond the visual line of
                        sight without violating FAA regulations. Our team was able to legally expand the search radius
                        by 2 miles while maintaining great connection between the ground control station and the
                        drones involved.

                    <h4>Revamped Coffee Dispenser</h4>
                    <p>For my team's final project in our Engineering Exploration class at the University of
                        Washington, we were assigned the topic of, "Making Breakfast Simpler." We chose to engineer a
                        revamped coffee machine that would simultaneously add the user's desired amount of sugar
                        and cream as their coffee brewed. Since this class was online due to Covid, we were unable to
                        print and assemble our project. As a team, we designed the dispenser in Autodesk Inventor
                        and simulated the functionality using an Arduino board.</p>

                    <h4>SIGHT</h4>
                    <p>SIGHT was my senior capstone project at the University of Washington. In collaboration with
                        two fellow engineers, we developed an advanced computer system to aid first responders in
                        wilderness search and rescue missions. Utilizing the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object
                        detection model and advanced image processing techniques, SIGHT provides accurate and
                        efficient identification of people across diverse terrains. Our model was trained on thousands
                        of annotated drone images from footage taken in differing conditions. Despite challenges due to
                        occlusion and numerous environmental factors, SIGHT achieved a 63% model precision with an
                        identification time of 105 ms. This displays the ability of SIGHT to balance performance and
                        efficiency in critical real-world situations. SIGHT showcases my ability to collaborate with
                        a team of engineers to solve a complex problem in a short period of time using machine
                        learning models.</p>
